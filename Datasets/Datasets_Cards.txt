    1. rates_interpolated.csv

      Daily interpolated risk-free rate series derived from the Fed Funds history input.
      The notebook converts the source rate column to a float, reindexes the data to a

      backward filling.

      Processing steps:
        Parse Rate column from string with comma decimals
        Convert rates to decimal form (divide by 100)
        Create daily date index from minimum to maximum date
        Interpolate missing values using time interpolation
        Apply forward fill and backward fill for edge dates
